# Fuwa Boilerplate

A Next.js boilerplate for testing features and experimenting with stuff. Fork it, break it, learn something.

## Stack

- **Next.js 14** (App Router)
- **React 18**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start messing around.

## Why

Because sometimes you just need a clean project to test things in without worrying about breaking anything important.
